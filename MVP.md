## MVP
The goal of this project is to predict whether a customer will change telecommunications provdier ,also known as "churning".

The target variable of this dataset is unbalanced with 86% of not churning and 14% of churning.

First, I will do a Exploratory Data Analaysis to get to know the dataset.Then, I will fit the dataset with different models to see which model is the best at predicting the outcome.

 Since the model is tending towards no , accuracy will have a bias , so I take both accuracy and F1 score as metrics for each model.

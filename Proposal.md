# Churn Prediction Project Proposal
## Question/need
- the purpose of this project is to tpredict whether a customer will change telecommunications provdier ,also known as "churning".
- The telecom companies will be beneficial from exploring this project 

## Data Description
- Churn Prediction 2020 Dataset from Kaggle
- 20 columns
- Training : 4250 rows
- Testing : 750 rows
- Including categorical and numeric features
- Target variable is the churn column which is binary 

## Tools
- Python : Data cleaning, data manipulation, Exploratory Data Analysis
- Sklearn,XGBoost : Machine learning algorithms
- Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly : Creating visuals for EDA
## MVP 
- Create an accurate model that can predict the churn rate well enough and examine what features are the concerns of churning
